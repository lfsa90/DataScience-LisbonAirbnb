## Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
* The code was developed and tested on anaconda with python 3.73. Nevertheless, it should run with no issues using Python 3.* in any other environment.

## Introduction / Motivation <a name="Introduction"></a>
This is an Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project.

For this project I chose Airbnb-Lisbon (my hometown) 2019 dataset ([here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)), and was mainly interested in finding the answers to the following questions:
1. Busiest times of the year in Lisbon and price fluctuation;
2. What are the most popular neighbourhoods and house types;
3. Main factors driving higher prices.
